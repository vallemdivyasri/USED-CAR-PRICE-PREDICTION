# CAR PRICE PREDICTION (USED CARS)
This project aims to predict the prices of used cars based on various features using machine learning techniques. Accurate car price predictions can be beneficial for both buyers and sellers in the automotive market, helping them make informed decisions.

****OVERVIEW****
Car price prediction is a complex task that involves understanding and analyzing a multitude of factors that affect used car prices. These factors can include the make and model of the car, year of manufacture, mileage, engine size, fuel type, and many more. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project seeks to build a predictive model that can provide reliable price estimates based on these attributes.

 # DATASET
 This dataset is took from kaggle, [Dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayaadithyanvg/car-price-predictionused-cars)
Dataset contains 301 rows and 9 columns. The features/attributes of dataset are:
1. Car_Name
2. Year
3. Selling_Price
4. Present_Price
5. Driven_kms
6. Fuel_Type
7. Selling_type
8. Transmission
9. Owner

# MODEL AND EVALUATION   
Implementation of various regression algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector has done to find the best model. Used metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate model performance.
